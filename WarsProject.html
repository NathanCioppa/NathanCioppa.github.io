                <span class="view-title">Revolutionary War</span>
                <p>In the Revolutionary War, American soldier's rations were supposed to
                    include meat, bread, beans or peas, and oftentimes rum or beer. However,
                    soldiers would often not receive even half of what they were supposed to,
                    since transporting food proved to be a challenge. Because of this issue,
                    Washington allowed for local farmers to sell food to the soldiers, but most
                    of them could not afford to buy food anyway. Another issue with rations at
                    the time was that many foods would spoil quickly, so much of what soldiers
                    were provided was salted or dry foods, which lasted much longer. Instead of regular bread, soldiers
                    ate hardtack, which was essentially a very dense, hard cracker. Hardtack was cheap
                    and lasted a long time, which made it the perfect food for the army.

            <div id="civ-view" class="view-contents">
                <span class="view-title">Civil War</span>
                <p>Union troops in the Civil War were given salt pork, coffee, and some sort of bread,
                     which was usually hardtack. It is said that some of the hardtack that the soldiers 
                     ate was leftover from the Mexican-American war, and oftentimes had bugs in it.
                      Soldiers would soak their hartack in coffee partially because that made it easier 
                      to eat, and partially because it would remove bugs from the hardtack by making 
                      them float to the surface of the coffee where soldiers could easily remove them.
                       Confederate troops did not have access to coffee, and were much more likely to 
                       receive cornbread or cornmeal as opposed to wheat products, since corn was grown 
                       locally and was much more available. </p>

                <p>American soldiers in the first world war ate similarly to soldiers in the civil 
                    war would have, with rations containing some sort of meat, hardtack, and coffee. 
                    During the war, Americans back home were encouraged to save food so that more 
                    could be sent to the soldiers, which would in turn help to win the war. There
                     were various campaigns started to encourage americans to save food. </p>

                <span class="view-title">World War II</span>
                <p>World War II saw the use of C-rations by the US military. C-rations came in many
                     varieties, much different from how soldiers would have eaten in past wars. Some of
                      those varieties include meat and spaghetti in tomato sauce, chopped ham, eggs and 
                      potatoes, meat and noodles, pork and beans, and chicken with vegetables. The 
                      rations also came with some sort of candy or chocolate, gum, biscuits, and 
                      cigarettes. The US military also experimented with another type of ration, known
                       as the K-ration. The K-ration was lightweight, and not as nutritional as C-rations 
                       were. They were originally made for paratroopers as well as soldiers in emergency 
                       situations. K-rations did not provide enough calories for soldiers that used them 
                       over a long period of time, and their usage was discontinued after the war. </p>

            <div id="kor-view" class="view-contents">
                <span class="view-title">Korean War and Vietnam War</span>
                <p>Starting with the Korean War and continuing through the 
                    Vietnam War, soldiers ate a revised version of C-rations. 
                    This revised version was designed to continuously feed 
                    soldiers in combat, much like the purpose of K-rations had 
                    been. Unlike K-rations, the new C-rations were successfully able 
                    to sustain troops. Soldiers oftentimes complained about 
                    the rations being heavy, as they weighed about five pounds. 
                    New varieties were introduced and along with the main meal, 
                    the rations would often include powdered milk and coffee,
                     a can of fruit, and once again cigarettes and gum. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="vie-view" class="view-contents">
                <span class="view-title">Modern Wars</span>
                <p>The modern military uses MREs, which stands for Meal Ready-to-Eat. 
                    MREs contain about 1200 calories, and include a large variety of 
                    meals. Each includes a main course, side dish, dessert or snack, 
                     crackers or bread, and a beverage. In addition to the actual
                      meal, the MRE contains utensils or (more commonly, just a 
                      single spoon), a flameless ration heater, and basic seasonings. 
                      Introduced in 2005, the vegetable cheese omelet MRE has become 
                      known as the worst MRE ever issued by the military. Soldiers 
                      complained not only about its taste, but even just the way it 
                      looked. The vegetable cheese omelet MRE was discontinued in 2009.</p>
                      <p>MREs have very strict packaging requirements. They must be able 
                        to withstand parachute drops from 1250 feet, and 98 foot drops 
                        without a parachute. They must also be able to maintain a shelf 
                        life of about 3 years if kept within an appropriate temperature 
                        range. Each weighs anywhere from 18 to 26 ounces. Although modern 
                        MREs are much better than previously used rations, the military is 
                        expected to provide soldiers with fresh food at least once every 21 
                        days, but preferably more often than that. </p>
